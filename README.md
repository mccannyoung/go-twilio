# go-twilio

Hello World! I'm learning golang and I know Twilio a bit (from C#), and noticed it doesn't have an official SDK. I will be relying on Twilio's [blog](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/06/sending-sms-from-your-go-app.html) [posts](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/10/making-and-receiving-phone-calls-with-golang.html) on how to use golang to access the Twilio API.
